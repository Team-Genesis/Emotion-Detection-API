    <h1>Facial Emotion Recognition</h1>
    
    <p>
        Under the guidance of Mr. Jitendra and Mr. Yogesh, I (Ishant Dahiya) am making a face and emotion recognition model to predict if the user is happy, sad, neutral, angry or in fear.

    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
    
    <h5>Databases used:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>http://download.visgraf.impa.br/</li>
        <li>http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/data/ck/</li>
        <li>http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/deepexpr/FERG_DB_256.zip</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Also to collect more images, I made a scraper using Selenium and urlib.request. I used these libraries becuase https://shutterstock.com used dynamically loaded pages with javascript, so I used firefox header with Selenium to get the data.

    </p>        
    
    <h3>Data Arrangement</h3>
    
   <p>
        The data was spread across different folders, coded differently in all the databases.
        
        I used some simple python scripts, to gather them into labelled folder so the model could read them easily.
   </p>
    
    
    <h3>Model</h3>
    
    <p>
        Encountered some problems while creating the model with VGG-16 model. (will attach the error logs). Used the keggle challenge dataset and approach to create the next model.

    </p>        
    <h3>Deployment</h3>
    
    <p>
        Used the Google Colab platform to run my model. My systemâ€™s hardware requirements were not adequate. The Colab platform also could run the model with GPU acceleration.
